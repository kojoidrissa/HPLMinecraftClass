# Teleport!


But that's not all. We can also *set* the player position. This means, yes, teleporting. We will type the python code like so:

```Python
In [4]: mc.player.setPos(10,11,12)
```

\* *POOF* \*

Let's think about what we did here. We just told Minecraft to set the x y and z position to 10, 11, and 12 respectively. As soon as we pressed enter, that command went through the *API* to our Minecraft game and plopped us directly where we told it to.
