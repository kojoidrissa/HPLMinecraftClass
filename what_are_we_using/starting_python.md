# Starting Python

Let's go back to our first tab in LXTerminal and start Python. Do this by typing:

```bash
$ ipython
```

That will start Python. Once you're in Python, you'll see that the command prompt now looks like `In [1]:`. This is where we'll type our code. It means the computer is waiting for us to type something. If your number doesn't match with mine, don't worry! What matters is that you type all the code in the same order I show.
