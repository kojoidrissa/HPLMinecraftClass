On our raspberry pi, there's a program we'll be using to talk to our computer. It's called LXTerminal, and you should be able to find it on your Desktop here:

We'll be using LXTerminal for almost all our work. Inside LXTerminal, you can create tabs. We'll do this now so we can have one tab running Minecraft and another tab running Python.
