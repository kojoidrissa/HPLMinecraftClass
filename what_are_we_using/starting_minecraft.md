# Starting Minecraft


On our second tab, let's start Minecraft. We can do this by typing the following:

```bash
$ cd ~/mcpi
$ ./minecraft-pi
```

And that should start Minecraft! Once you're in, go ahead and start a new game and create a new world.

>We don't type the `$` when we enter our code because it's already there. This is called the command prompt, and we'll talk more about it later.
